## Asteroid Checker

## Description

This app will connect to NASA API through endpoints provided by RapidAPI.com and retrieve data, which includes daily data for near Earth asteroids. With this app, you can check the closest asteroid to Earth and its statistics on any given date. Alternatively, NASA uploads beautiful pictures every day, and their Picture of the Dayc pictures and other epi can also be accessed through the API's, so this app will also be able to pull up any particular date's picture of the day (or other, possibly random, picture that NASA uploaded that day).

## API

I will be using NASA API with endpoints provided by RapidAPI website. Here is an example https://rapidapi.com/dimas/api/NasaAPI?endpoint=apiendpoint_b4e69440-f966-11e7-809f-87f99bda0814getClosestAsteroids

## MVP

I would like to sort through and pull up the closest asteroid to Earth on any given day. So the user should be able to input a date and get stats (size, velocity, distance to Earth) about the closest asteroid for that day, also whether it is dangerous or not. The user should also be able to view NASA's picture of the day for any given date.

## Post-MVP

Add more statistics for the asteroids. Make fun visual comparisons using CSS/JS animation - for example, compare the distance of asteroid to Earth to the distance from Earth to the Moon. Or comparing the size of the asteroid to something with similar area (big asteroids can compare to Texas, smaller can be compared to Manhattan and so on).

Adding good looking CSS and animations involving asteroids would be a cool feature to have.
